# SnakeEverywhere
The Goal of this Project is to make Snake for as many platforms as possible.

If you want to help follow there rules:
there should only be 1 apple rendered (if the one is gone another one should get spawned)
if the player touches the top/bottom/left end or right end it should teleport him to the other side.
if the player touches his tail he should be resetted.

If you have ported this version of Snake to a platform not yet on the list contact me on Discord: Trynera#5577 (I will credit you!)
